GAME PROFILE
------------------------------------------------------------------
The game uses a profile.txt file to save user progress.

If you encounter any problems during play, or if you wish to reset
your progress, delete profile.txt and relaunch the application.

For debugging purposes, you can change the values in
profile.txt. (e.g. set stars to 100 so you can unlock everything)

------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGING AVAILABLE PUZZLES
------------------------------------------------------------------
The pool of puzzles available in the game is taken from the
resources/puzzles folder.

You can add or remove images from this folder before building the
project to change the puzzles that are available during play.

The game also enumerates the available puzzles each time you go to
the puzzle selection screen.

To change which puzzles are available during runtime, navigate to
the appropriate build folder and remove/add images inside the
puzzles folder as desired.
